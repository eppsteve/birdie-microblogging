# Birdie: Twitter Clone

This is a twitter-like micro blogging application written in node.js and mongodb. 


**Features**

- Node.js/Express backend providing a RESTful API.
- MongoDB for data store.
- Authentication with passport middleware.
- Front-end built with Handlebars and jQuery.
- Real-time communication using long-polling. 
*(I know this sucks as there are better techniques to achieve real-time communication like socket.io but currently I am too busy to make any improvements)*
